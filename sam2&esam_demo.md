# SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos

## Installation

SAM 2 needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git && cd sam2

pip install -e .
```
If you are installing on Windows, it's strongly recommended to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Ubuntu.

To use the SAM 2 predictor and run the example notebooks, `jupyter` and `matplotlib` are required and can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

Note:
1. It's recommended to create a new Python environment via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for this installation and install PyTorch 2.3.1 (or higher) via `pip` following https://pytorch.org/. If you have a PyTorch version lower than 2.3.1 in your current environment, the installation command above will try to upgrade it to the latest PyTorch version using `pip`.
2. The step above requires compiling a custom CUDA kernel with the `nvcc` compiler. If it isn't already available on your machine, please install the [CUDA toolkits](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) with a version that matches your PyTorch CUDA version.
3. If you see a message like `Failed to build the SAM 2 CUDA extension` during installation, you can ignore it and still use SAM 2 (some post-processing functionality may be limited, but it doesn't affect the results in most cases).

Please see [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for FAQs on potential issues and solutions.

## Getting Started


### Image prediction

SAM 2 has all the capabilities of [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) on static images, and we provide image prediction APIs that closely resemble SAM for image use cases. The `SAM2ImagePredictor` class has an easy interface for image prompting.



```bash
Change to the directory named SAM2.
```

```python
import torch
from sam2.build_sam import build_sam2
from sam2.sam2_image_predictor import SAM2ImagePredictor

# Important: The model weights are specified here. Please replace them with the SAM2 checkpoint we provided.
checkpoint = "./checkpoints/sam2.1_hiera_tiny.pt"
model_cfg = "configs/sam2.1/sam2.1_hiera_t.yaml"
predictor = SAM2ImagePredictor(build_sam2(model_cfg, checkpoint))

with torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast("cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
    masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

Please refer to the examples in [image_predictor_example.ipynb](./notebooks/image_predictor_example.ipynb) (also in Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/sam2/blob/main/notebooks/image_predictor_example.ipynb)) for static image use cases.

SAM 2 also supports automatic mask generation on images just like SAM. Please see [automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb](./notebooks/automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb) (also in Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/sam2/blob/main/notebooks/automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb)) for automatic mask generation in images.
